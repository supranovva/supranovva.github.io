        It's always fun when brands do an identity makeover. You don't even have to be so involved with the graphic design world to be affected. Some will like it, some won't. But above all, these serve as their statement on where they stand in this ever-changing scene of design and marketing.
        <br><br>
        We saw different approaches this year, some went for energetic and the usual minimalistic styles of today, while some tapped into nostalgia and took a retro approach.. and I'm telling you, some took on some dramatic changes.
        <br><br>
        Here, I'm excited to present to you some of the rebrandings this year that really caught me (not necessarily positively <i>wink wink</i>). Some of these aren't much heard about, so watch out for 'em!

      <span class="subtitle">
        BRAND #1 — PEPSI<br>

        After 14 years, Pepsi has finally rebranded with a bold, 70s-inspired logo. PepsiCo chief design officer Mauro Porcini stated that the goal of the redesign is to establish a visual identity that connects with the consumers of today, while also honoring the brand's heritage.
        <br><br>
        This is well achieved with its retro-revitalized approach similar to Burger King's 2021 redesign, which frankly speaking, is a refreshing breath of air in the scene of oversaturated modern-minimalist logos in the market today.
        <br><br>
        Needless to say, everyone absolutely loved it!

        BRAND #2 — NOKIA<br>

        Nokia is no longer just a mobile phone brand.
        <br><br>
        That is the message Nokia is trying to convey in this bold step in their journey. While it was known for having created <i>the most indestructible cellphone</i>, Nokia now focuses on networks and industrial digitalization. It is now known for its innovations in B2B communication technology.
        <br><br>
        Nokia's new logo boasts a lighter, sharper, more futurist visual identity that represents its role in today's cutting-edge technology. Still, compared to generic tech logos, it still manages to feel refreshingly different, and rightfully so!
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <span class="subtitle">
        BRAND #3 — BOLT<br>
        <img class="content-img" src="assets/bolt.png">
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <span>
        'Shockingly simple' checkout.
        <br>
        That's Bolt in three words, and Koto Studio did such an amazing job at bringing this vision to life.
        <br><br>
        Bolt's new logo makes very clever use of negative space in its design. The negative space between the 'L' and 'T' forms a lightning bolt, just like how the negative space between the 'e' and 'x' in FedEx were meant to form an arrow.
        <br><br>The redesign also comes with this energetic bright yellow-green color palette and an 'electrified' typeface customization that I both just love!
      </span>

    <div class="content">
      <span class="subtitle">
        BRAND #4 — MYERS & BRIGGS FOUNDATION<br>
        <img class="content-img" src="assets/myersbriggs.png">

    <div class="content">
      <span>
        The Myers & Briggs Foundation, world-renowned for its personality type assessment, steps forward with a contemporary, humanist approach to brand identity. 
        <br><br>
        The new logo features a flower, representing personal growth through understanding, which is emblematic of the work of the foundation. Creative studio Parker also systematically curated a color system set up to provide 16 possible combinations, each corresponding to one of the 16 MBTI personality types.
        <br><br>
        This rebranding is much less heard about, but I personally really like it!
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <span class="subtitle">
        BRAND #5 — X (TWITTER)<br>
        <img class="content-img" src="assets/x.png">

    <div class="content">
      <span>
        This is the part where I remind you that this is not just a post on cool redesigns. This is a recap, and here comes the controversial bit.
        <br><br>
        It was revealed by newly installed CEO Linda Yaccarino that the rebrand was a step towards Elon Musk's goal of turning Twitter into some sort of super-app. It was acquired by X Corp as an accelerant for X, the supposed 'everything' app, apparently along with ensuring freedom of speech, according to Elon Musk himself.
        <br><br>
        Frankly speaking, I wouldn't even call this controversial — everyone damn sure hated it.. except Elon, I guess.
      </span>

    <div class="content">
      <span class="subtitle">
        BRAND #6 — PATREON<br>
        <img class="content-img" src="assets/patreon.png">
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <span>
        Patreon promises a brand identity 'built for, and with, creators.' 
        This leaves us with a new logo: a deliberately ephemeral, dynamic, formless blob loosely keeping resemblance with a 'P', meant to represent 'the energy of creativity and the ever-evolving nature of culture and art.' The logo is supposed to be able to take on various forms, with which Patreon is working to enable creators to create their own in the spirit of community.
        <br><br>
        The redesign has been mostly compared with that of X — that same scenarion of attempting to modernize too hard, you lose the identity of the brand for the sake of appearing contemporary. The result, many viewed as simply vague, uninspired, and quite unnecessary.
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <span class="subtitle">
        BRAND #7 — FREEPIK<br>
        <img class="content-img" src="assets/freepik.png">
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <span>
        Finally, we arrive at the end of the list.
        <br><br>
        Freepik rebrands with a bold and playful visual identity to represent 'the fluidity and freedom of the creative process.' The new logo features an inverted 'i' that acts as an exclamation point to further convey the vision of the brand.
        <br><br>
        While some liked the rebrand, some more didn't. There were issues mostly on the legibility of the logo, and some felt it looked cheap and didn't represent what Freepik was actually about: an audio-visual media resource.
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <span>
        And, well, that's it for my list.
        <br><br>
        Those are just 7 of the many rebrands that actually happened this year. I mean, did you know that we're sadly waving goodbye to the iconic mountain in the Toblerone logo?
        <br><br>
        Whatever, cheers to more cool and fun rebrandings next year!
